This is the official implementatin for MS-DETR.

Please note,  **this project is a work in progress** , with many opportunities for further development and organization.

A majority of the existing bugs can be traced back to **version inconsistencies in kn_util** (my personal utility toolkit). As time permits, I'll address these compatibility issues.

Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated:)
