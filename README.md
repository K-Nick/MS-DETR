This is the official implementatin for MS-DETR.

Please bear in mind that this isn't the completed version of the project, and there is still ample scope for enhancements and proper structuring. Most of buggy functions are caused by versioning of kn_util (my personal utilility toolkit).

We deeply appreciate your patience and understanding:)
